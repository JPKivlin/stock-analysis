# stock-analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a stock analysis tool that will analyze the entire stock market over the last few years.

## Results
Of the stocks reviewed, it is clear that based on the "return", only 2 stocks have had postive returns in 2017 & 2018.  Those stocks are "ENPH" & "RUN".  Refactoring the code also allowed for a more efficient use of computing resources as is evident by the run time.

## Summary
In summary, refactoring code is an important part of the overall coding process.  A disadvantage of this can be that it uses more complex language and can take longer.  In the end it is advantageous due to the efficiencies in computing power and cleaner code writing.
